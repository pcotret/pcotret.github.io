# Installing Microsemi Libero 2021.3 on Ubuntu 20 LTS


> Mostly based on this great tutorial : https://bobbl.github.io/fpga/microsemi/2021/04/30/install-libero-update.html

##Â Prerequisites

```bash
sudo apt install libxtst6:i386 libxrender1:i386 apt-file lsb xfonts-intl-asian xfonts-intl-chinese xfonts-intl-chinese-big xfonts-intl-japanese xfonts-intl-japanese-big ksh libxft2:i386 libgtk2.0-0:i386 libcanberra-gtk-module:i386 libqt5xdg-dev:i386
```

You may need other QT related packages in their i386 flavour.

## Get License

Create a directory for the license server (here I use ``~/.local/share/microsemi/license``)

```bash
mkdir --p /home/USERNAME/.local/share/microsemi/license
```

Download the "Linux Daemon" from https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/design-resources/1711-licensing#downloads to the license directory and extract it with:

```bash
tar xf Linux_Licensing_Daemon.tar.Z
```

Create an account on https://www.microsemi.com and request a "Libero Silver 1Yr Floating License for Windows/Linux Server". You have to enter your MAC address (12 hexadecimal digits without colons), which you can get by typing

```bash
ip link | grep ether
```

The license file is sent via email. Store the license file ``License.dat`` in the license directory. 

Now the first four lines of the license file must be edited, but *not the rest of the file*. In the first line, replace ``<put.hostname.here>`` by ``localhost``. In lines 2 to 4 replace ``PATH`` by the absolute path to the license daemon directory. The first 4 lines schould then look like that:

    SERVER localhost 112233445566 1702
    DAEMON actlmgrd /home/USERNAME/.local/share/microsemi/license/Linux_Licensing_Daemon/actlmgrd
    DAEMON mgcld /home/USERNAME/.local/share/microsemi/license/Linux_Licensing_Daemon/mgcld
    VENDOR snpslmd /home/USERNAME/.local/share/microsemi/license/Linux_Licensing_Daemon/snpslmd

The license manager requires that `/usr/tmp` exists (otherwise you get "FlexNet Licensing error:-25,234")

```bash
sudo ln -s /tmp /usr/tmp
```

Install the depedencies

```bash
sudo apt install lsb
```

And start the license server with

```bash
Linux_Licensing_Daemon/lmgrd -c License.dat -log /tmp/lmgrd.log
```

If you get a "file not found" error, install lsb.

On my system I have the problem that the license works only for a few minutes.
I don't know why, but when I start Libero a second time after a few minutes,
it doesn't recognise the license. Stopping and restarting the license server
helps:

```bash
Linux_Licensing_Daemon/lmdown -c License.dat -q
Linux_Licensing_Daemon/lmgrd -c License.dat -log /tmp/lmgrd.log
```

## Install Libero

Download "Libero SoC v2021.3 for Linux" from https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/design-resources/1750-libero-soc#downloads.

The downloaded binary is a self-extracting archive built with InstallAnywhere. Before executing it, set its execute bit must be set and some dependencies have to be installed:

```bash
chmod +x Libero_SoC_v2021.3_lin.bin
./Libero_SoC_v2021.3_lin.bin
```

Before actually starting Libero, some environment variables have to be set:

```bash
export LM_LICENSE_FILE=1702@localhost
export SNPSLMD_LICENSE_FILE=1702@localhost
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/:/usr/lib
```

Now, you can launch Libero SoC:

```bash
/opt/microsemi/Libero_SoC_v2021.3/Libero/bin
```
